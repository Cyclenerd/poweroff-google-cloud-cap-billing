# How to contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding style

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. It is optimized for readability:

* Please stick to the [Terraform style conventions](https://www.terraform.io/language/syntax/style).
* Please run `terraform fmt`.
* Be nice.

One more thing:

* Keep it simple! 👍

Thanks! ❤️❤️❤️
